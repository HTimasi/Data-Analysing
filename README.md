Hi, in last few months, I've been working on the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
Here I will share what I have done as a final capstone. In this case study, I will be analyzing a public dataset a bike-share company in Chicago. I will be using the R programming language for data analysis and Tableau for visualizations.

## About the company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geo tracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

## the following data analysis steps will be followed:

* Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, Act.

## Ask

The questions that need to be answered are:
1- How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2- Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3- How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Prepare

The dataset follows the ROCCC Analysis as described below:
Reliable - yes, not biased
Original - yes, can locate the original public data
Comprehensive - yes, not missing important information
Current - yes, updated monthly
Cited - yes
I will be using the public dataset located [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). 
Key Tasks Followed:

1- Downloaded data and copies have been stored on the computer.
2- I have downloaded the data for April 21-March 22 Period.
3- The data is in CSV (comma-separated values) format, and there are a total of 13 columns.
